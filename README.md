# BI Assessment

## Main assessment

In the `main_assessment` folder, there is the file `main_assessment_code.R` which contains the R code for the main BI assessment. Under the `main_assessment/csv` folder there is also the csv input file `orders_jan_2021.csv` that is needed to run the code.

How to run:

1. Clone the repository to your local directory.
2. Open the `main_assessment_code.R` with Rstudio* and set the variable `working_directory` to the path of the directory you just cloned. 
3. Run the code line by line with Rstudio and navigate through the results.

Certain outputs will also be saved in the corresponding folders:

* Plots in the `main_assessment/plots` folder.
* Clustering results in the `main_assessment/csv`.

*You can download R and Rstudio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

## Mini assessment

In the `mini_assessment` folder, there is the file `mini_assessment_code.sql` which contains the SQL query for the mini assessment.
